### Installation
I have provided both clean samples and samples with a pseudo-radio effect applied for you to choose from.

1) Ensure you are starting with a fresh install of Cold Waters and DotMod v0.4a-2.
2) Download the latest version of the mod from [Releases](https://github.com/wellers/cold-waters-british-voice-pack/releases).
3) If you use JSGME with Cold Waters, unzipped the contents of the downloaded zip and add either the _clean_ or _radio-effect_ samples folder (or even a mix of the samples if you prefer) into your MODS folder.
4) Open JSGME. The addon should appear under "Available Mods". 
5) Activate the mod.
   
_Note:_ if you don't want to install the mod using JSGME, you can just copy the clean of radio-effect's "ColdWaters_Data" folder into your Cold Waters installation directory - the content matches the folder structure.

### Notes:
* Metric Units are spoken so I would suggest you enable the **Metric system** under **Options** > **Game**.
* These sounds will replace the default US English crew voice pack. 
* If you want to revert back to the US voice pack and you didn't use JSGME to activate the mod, just rename the voices folder in ColdWaters_Data\StreamingAssets\override\audio to something other than *voices* or *voice_ru*.
