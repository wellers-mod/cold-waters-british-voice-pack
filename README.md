## Cold Waters British voice pack
AI-generated British accent voice pack for Cold Waters - a great addition for your Royal Navy Campaigns.\
Requires at least dotmod v0.4a-2.

### Installation
1) In your Cold Waters install directory, create an *audio* folder under ColdWaters_Data\StreamingAssets\override.
2) Create a new *voices* folder under the *audio* directory.
3) Add all voice pack files to the *voices* folder.

Note:
* Metric Units are spoken so I would suggest you enable the **Metric system** under **Options** > **Game**.
* These sounds will replace the default US English crew voice pack. 
* If you want to revert back to the US voice pack, just rename the voices folder you added to ColdWaters_Data\StreamingAssets\override\audio to something other than *voices* or *voice_ru*.
