### Installation
I have provided both clean samples and samples with a pseudo-radio effect applied for you to choose from.

1) Ensure you are starting with a fresh install of Cold Waters and DotMod v0.4a-2.
2) If you use JSGME with Cold Waters, add either the clean or radio-effect samples (or a mix if you prefer) folder to your MODS folder and activate through JSGME.exe.
   
_Note:_ if you don't use JSGME, you can just copy the samples folder into your Cold Waters installation directory as the content matches the folder structure.

### Notes:
* Metric Units are spoken so I would suggest you enable the **Metric system** under **Options** > **Game**.
* These sounds will replace the default US English crew voice pack. 
* If you want to revert back to the US voice pack and you didn't use JSGME to activate the mod, just rename the voices folder in ColdWaters_Data\StreamingAssets\override\audio to something other than *voices* or *voice_ru*.
